# 06.30 Tomorin - Telegram Userbot

GitHub: [tsukinaha/tomorin](https://www.github.com/tsukinaha/tomorin)

I have recently written a Telegram userbot by gramme.rs, it has serval features:
- exec shell command `<,/，/./。> <command>`
- repeat message: reply to a message with `+`
- eval Rust code: use 
    ```
    r#
    <code>
    ```

    for example:
    ```
    r#
    struct Foo {
        bar: i32,
    }

    size_of::<Foo>()
    ```

    this will return `4` in the chat.

### To use it

```shell
git clone https://www.github.com/tsukinaha/tomorin
cd tomorin
cargo build --release
```

Now you can run it with `./target/release/tomorin`.   
At the first run, it will generate a `config.kdl` file, you need to fill it in your details.    
Run it again, and follow the instructions (maybe verification code or 2FA).
